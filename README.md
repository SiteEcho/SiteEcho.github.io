# Server Rules & Guidelines

Welcome to our community! Our goal is to create a safe, fair, respectful, and enjoyable environment for everyone. To achieve this, we have detailed rules to guide behavior and interactions. Please take time to carefully read and understand these guidelines.

---

### 1. No Spamming or Disruptive Behavior

Spamming harms conversations, frustrates members, and clutters channels.

* **Definition of spam:**

  * Sending the same message repeatedly in short succession.
  * Posting long, irrelevant blocks of text without contributing meaningfully.
  * Excessive use of emojis, GIFs, stickers, or reactions that disrupt normal chat flow.
  * Flooding chat with excessive caps lock, symbols, punctuation, or multiple lines that make reading difficult.
  * Rapidly sending commands or bot triggers that interrupt conversations.
  * Pinging @everyone, @here, or individual users repeatedly without valid reason or permission.
* **Good practices:**

  * Ensure your messages add value or engage positively with ongoing discussions.
  * Use caps lock, emojis, and formatting sparingly to emphasize points, not overwhelm.
  * If you have a lot to say, consider breaking it into multiple messages spaced out over time or using a forum post where appropriate.
* **Nickname and profile considerations:**

  * Avoid setting excessively long or disruptive nicknames that cause layout issues or “channel floods.”
  * Profile pictures and statuses should not be visually disruptive or offensive.

### 2. Respect All Members

Respect and kindness form the foundation of our community.

* **General respect:**

  * Treat everyone with kindness regardless of their background, opinions, or experience level.
  * Avoid name-calling, insults, or dismissive comments that belittle others.
  * Assume positive intent and be patient, especially with newcomers or those unfamiliar with community norms.
* **Harassment & bullying:**

  * Do not repeatedly target or provoke any member through direct messages, mentions, or public chat.
  * Avoid passive-aggressive remarks or indirect harassment such as “subtweeting” or creating exclusionary cliques.
* **Pronouns & identities:**

  * Use the pronouns and names people request. Purposeful misgendering, deadnaming, or invalidating someone’s identity is disrespectful.
  * Avoid assumptions about anyone’s identity or experiences based on stereotypes.
* **Triggering or sensitive topics:**

  * Refrain from making jokes or dismissive comments about mental health, trauma, or personal hardships.
  * If you discuss sensitive topics, use trigger warnings and do so in designated channels when available.
* **Conflict resolution:**

  * Handle disagreements calmly and privately when possible. Avoid public arguments or drama.
  * Reach out to moderators if a conflict escalates or cannot be resolved amicably.

### 3. No Inappropriate or NSFW Content

Our community is open to diverse ages and backgrounds; content must be appropriate for a general audience.

* **Prohibited content includes:**

  * Pornography, nudity, sexually explicit or suggestive images, videos, or text.
  * Graphic violence, gore, or disturbing images or descriptions.
  * Jokes or comments trivializing or glorifying trauma, abuse, terrorism, school shootings, or other sensitive events.
* **Profiles and usernames:**

  * Usernames, nicknames, profile pictures, and statuses must be free from NSFW or offensive material.
* **Discussion of mature topics:**

  * Sexual health, mental health, or other mature topics should only be discussed in designated, private, or support channels if available.
* **Media and files:**

  * Do not upload or share content that violates these guidelines or Discord’s Terms of Service.
* **Jokes and humor:**

  * Humor is subjective, but avoid jokes that rely on offensive stereotypes or sensitive subject matter.

### 4. No Illegal or Harmful Activities

Safety and legality are paramount in our community.

* **Illegal activities:**

  * Do not discuss, promote, or encourage illegal actions such as drug use, weapons manufacturing, hacking, fraud, or violence.
* **Threats and self-harm:**

  * Avoid making threats, wishing harm, or encouraging self-harm or suicide. If you or someone you know is struggling, consider reaching out to professionals or trusted staff for support.
* **Personal information & privacy:**

  * Never share personally identifiable information (PII) of yourself or others without explicit consent. This includes full names, addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, social media links, or other private data.
* **Predatory behavior:**

  * Attempts to exploit or manipulate others, especially minors, for personal gain or harmful purposes, will not be tolerated.
* **Security:**

  * Do not attempt hacking, phishing, scamming, or any behavior that threatens members’ safety or the server’s integrity.

### 5. No Offensive Language or Hate Speech

We foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.

* **Hate speech and slurs:**

  * Any language or symbols that promote hatred or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other identity is strictly prohibited.
* **Discrimination:**

  * Treat all members fairly and without prejudice. Avoid stereotyping or making derogatory remarks about any group.
* **Profanity:**

  * While occasional mild profanity may be tolerated, avoid excessive or targeted swearing, especially when it is meant to offend or intimidate others.
* **Respectful communication:**

  * Use language that contributes to constructive and positive interactions. If offended by language, report it rather than retaliate.

### 6. Fair Play & Server Integrity

Our community values fair and fun gameplay experiences for all.

* **Bug and glitch handling:**

  * Report bugs or glitches to staff promptly instead of abusing them for advantage.
* **Server stability:**

  * Avoid actions that cause lag, crashes, or other technical problems that degrade server performance.
* **Advertising & promotions:**

  * Unsolicited advertising or promotion of other servers, social media, products, or services is not allowed without prior approval.
* **Cheats and hacks:**

  * The use of unauthorized software, mods, or tools that provide unfair advantages—such as aimbots, X-ray, freecam, auto-clickers, or macros—is prohibited.
* **PvP and player interactions:**

  * Repeatedly targeting or killing players who are not engaging in PvP or have expressed non-aggression is discouraged.
  * Avoid using alternate accounts (alts) to bypass rules or gain unfair benefits.
* **Community respect:**

  * Play in ways that respect other players’ enjoyment and the spirit of fair competition.

### 7. Ban & Mute Evasion

Maintaining fairness requires respecting moderator decisions.

* Using alternate accounts or other methods to bypass bans or mutes undermines community trust and fairness.
* Attempting to circumvent restrictions via indirect communication (signs, books, etc.) is also discouraged.

### 8. Encouraging or Assisting Rule Breaking

Promoting positive behavior helps maintain our community’s health.

* Do not encourage, assist, or incite others to violate any of these rules.
* Avoid suggesting or supporting activities such as spamming, harassment, cheating, or rule evasion.
* Members are encouraged to lead by example and promote respectful, rule-abiding conduct.
